         <p style="font-family:Brush Script MT; font-size:30px">Welcome to my poetry corner! I'm Pragni Naik, a passionate poet with a heart full of words and emotions. Writing has always been my way of expressing the depths of my soul, and poetry has become the canvas for my thoughts and dreams.

In this little virtual sanctuary, I pour my heart out through verses and stanzas, exploring the beauty of life, love, nature, and everything that touches my soul. Each poem reflects a piece of my journey, a moment frozen in time, or an emotion set free.

As a lover of words, I find inspiration in the smallest details of everyday life. From the whispers of the wind to the colors of the setting sun, I aim to capture these fleeting moments and weave them into a tapestry of emotions that resonate with each reader.

This website is not just a collection of poems; it's a journey shared with you, dear reader. I hope my words find a place in your heart and inspire you in your own way.

Thank you for joining me on this poetic adventure. Let's explore the world of verses together and find solace in the symphony of words.
<br><br>
With love and gratitude,<br>
Pragni
