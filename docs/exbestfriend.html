Dear Ex-Bestfriend,<br>
Frankly,I don't miss you now<br>
But I miss the memories which were wow.<br>
I never thought I would write this letter,<br>
For I knew we were always better together.<br>
There were some things upon which we didn't agree<br>
And then came the day we were set free<br>
From always laughing on eachother,<br>
To never talking with onne another.<br>
I always wonder what went wrong with us,<br>
As we never discussed ,<br>
The thing that broke our trust.<br>
However my friend,<br>
I don't miss you now,<br>
But the memories which were wow.<br></p>
